# CPlusPlus-Program

# Summary
This school project was to create an application involving Python and C++. I was given three requirements to fulfill which included producing a list of all items purchased in a given day along with the amount of item each item was purchased, displaying a number representing how many times a specific item was purchased in a given day, and displaying a histogram for all items purchased during a given day along with how many of each item was purchased. 

*Please note that some sections of the code were written and given by Southern New Hampshire University, and they are the sole owners of it.
