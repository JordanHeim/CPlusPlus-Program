# CPlusPlus-Program

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving
The project was to complete a program for Corner Grocer. They wanted text records to be analyzed that they collect thoughout the day. The three requirements were to produce a list of all items purchased in a given day along with the amount of time each item was purchased, display a number representing how many times a specific item was purchased in a given day, and display a histogram for all itmes purchased during a given day along with how many of each item was purchased. I used CPP and Python to complete this project.

# What did you do particularly well 
I did well in the CPP part of coding. I was very confident in my ability to get all the requirements of my code done in CPP. I am not as confident with Python but was able to excel in all the requirements that were needed for the project. 

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could come up with a function to read a file and write to a file instead of doing it for each funciton individually. That would get decrease the duplicate coding that was needed. I could also add a function for the user to select a character to represent the item amount purchased during the day. This would make the program more interactive for the user. 

# Which pieces of the code did you find the most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resouces are you adding to your support network?
I had a little trouble using Pythons built in libraries. I am not as familiar with Python, but was able to do some of my own research on the internet to find functions that would be useful in my program. One of the main built in function that was useful was the sort. Using sort made going through the list easier and made the display method easier to execute. Using both languages together was also a little challenging. However, I am constantly learning new methods and ways of coding and will be keeping that in my back pocket for future projects. 

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work? 
Using two languages is useful and can save you the trouble of having to do more complex coding. CPP is fast and great for certain things, and Python is useful for anlayzing data. Having the skill of using two languages together and becoming more familiar with both will provide me with better ways to solve other projects that are more complex.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable
My program has comments to help the reader understand what I was trying to accomplish at certain parts within my program. I also made sure everything was properly aligned and sorted for readability. Several functions were used so that they could be updated indivdually and without the need to update the entire program.
